The GitHub repository Sales-Summary-from-SQLite-Database-using-Python provides a straightforward example of using SQL within Python to extract and visualize sales data.

üìÑ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

Connect to a SQLite database using Python.

Execute SQL queries to retrieve sales information, such as total quantity sold and total revenue.

Display the retrieved data using basic print statements.

Visualize the sales summary through a simple bar chart.

üìÅ Repository Contents
sales_summary.py: The main Python script that connects to the SQLite database, executes SQL queries, and generates the bar chart.

sales_data.csv: A sample CSV file containing sales data used for demonstration purposes.

total_revenue_per_product.png: The output image file showcasing the bar chart of total revenue per product.

This project demonstrates how to use Python to connect to a SQLite database, perform SQL queries, and visualize the results. It focuses on extracting a sales summary including total quantity sold and total revenue generated per product.

Requirements:
Python 3.x

pandas

matplotlib

sqlite3 (built-in with Python)

How to Run:
1.Clone the repository or download the files.

2.Make sure all dependencies are installed:
pip install pandas matplotlib

3.Run the Python script:
python sales_summary.py

4.The script will display a summary and save a bar chart as total_revenue_per_product.png.

| **Use SQL inside Python**  | ‚úÖ          | The script uses the `sqlite3` module to connect to a SQLite database and run SQL queries. |
| **Pull simple sales info** | ‚úÖ          | It retrieves total quantity sold and total revenue grouped by product.                    |
| **Basic print statements** | ‚úÖ          | It prints the summary results in the terminal.                                            |
| **Simple bar chart**       | ‚úÖ          | It uses `matplotlib` to display a bar chart showing total revenue per product.            |

üìù Summary:
The project provides a minimal, functional example of extracting and visualizing sales data using SQL in Python ‚Äî ideal for educational or proof-of-concept use.
 
    This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand the integration of SQL queries within Python and basic data visualization techniques.
